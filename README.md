# 🖼️ Image Processing & Classification – Kitchen Items
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **image classification pipeline** using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It includes loading images, preprocessing them, building a model, training it, and making predictions on **kitchen item images**. The goal of this repository is to showcase basic image processing, feature extraction, and model-building skills in an easy-to-understand notebook workflow.

## 🚀 Project Features
- Load & preprocess image datasets  
- Convert images into numerical arrays  
- Resize, normalize, and augment images  
- Build and train a machine learning / deep learning model  
- Evaluate performance and visualize predictions  
- Classify images into categories like: **spoon, cup, plate, glass, knife, fork, bowl, etc.**
